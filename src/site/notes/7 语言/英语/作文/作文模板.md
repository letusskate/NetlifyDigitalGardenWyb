| The reasons are presented below.                                                                                   | 原因如下。                                                                               |
| There are three premier(主要的)/best/ most important, largest, significant, obvious, crucial causes as follows.    | 以下这些是造成这一问题的最主要/最好/最重要/最大/最有意义/明显/至关重要的原因。           |
| This is based on the propensity(倾向，原因) of following points.                                                   | 这基于以下的原因。                                                                       |
| The main reason is that..                                                                                          | 主要原因是\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_。                                                   |
| One very important argument for ..... is that....                                                                  | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 的非常重要的原因便是\_\_\_\_\_。                                           |
| The reasons are quite clear. Above all, ....                                                                       | 原因非常清楚。首先 (首要的是)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_。                                       |
| The first reason can be seen by every person.                                                                      | 第一个原因其实很明显。                                                                   |
| The first and most important reason is that.....                                                                   | 第一个而且最重要的原因是\_\_\_\_。                                                       |
| One of the reasons that are given for....is that....                                                               | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 的原因之一是\_\_\_\_                                         |
| Perhaps this is because of the simple fact that.....                                                               | 也许，原因很简单，亦即\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_                                             |
| One of the premier causes is that                                                                                  | 最重要的原因之一便是\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_                                           |
| At the risk of sounding too simplistic, it seems to me that the main propositions can be summarized in one saying. | 这个原因可能较简单，不过，我认为可以用一句谚语来概括，\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_。                 |
| We may look into every possible reason, however, foremost reason for .... Is ....                                  | 其实有很多原因，不过，造成\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 的最重要的原因是\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_。 |
| It might also be noted that..                                                                                      | 需要注意的是，\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_。                                                 |
