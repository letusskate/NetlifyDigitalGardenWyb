## Introduction
### 不同点
From a technical standpoint, this requires a significant technical departure from the no-regret caching settings studied by prior art \[10, 62, 65, 66, 71, 74\], both due to its distributed nature and the generality of the network topology.

### 创新点
**In comparison to the existing literature, the novelty of this work arises mainly from the combination of the**  
**following important factors**: (1) the primary focus of this work is on low-end embedded IoT devices, as opposed  
to less-constrained high-end mobile devices coupled with cloud servers, (2) the stochastic communication delay is  
explicitly taken into account using an efective MDP modeling framework, (3) optimal and lightweight solutions  
are presented to solve the energy minimization problems at hand, with extensive experimental validation, and  
\(4\) the performance of diferent data transfer schemes is explored for reducing the energy consumption of IoT  
device.
